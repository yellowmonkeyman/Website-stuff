        <div class="grid-item1" id = "rcorners1">My name is Richard, I am 27 and have had an interesting life. I progressed well at school, leaving with good grades and the idea of studying Medicine at University. That is what I did. Eventually after three years of studying I decided it wasn't for me and I left with some mental health difficulties. subsequent to this I've struggled to find a fulfilling career path.  Thankfully I've ended up at Codenation on their dev course. Although finding and getting a place on the course was only by chance, I have thoroughly enjoyed the content so far. The course can be demanding in terms of the time-frame tasks have to be completed in, but that is an essential skill to have. I hope to progress to a career within this sector, or at least within a similar vein.
