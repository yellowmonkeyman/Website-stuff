            <p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
            Data storage, manipulation and communication are a huge part of modern business practice. Information Technology has evolved to allow for a huge amount of data circulating through networks (including the internet) and more data storage than ever. The user base of computers has increased alongside this, partly due to the accessibility of computer systems. Business are therefore finding that they can use IT to automate certain processes, access the now massive user base of the internet and store data collected from these interactions and processes.</p>
            <p>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects 
                You need to know what you're going to do, the best method for achieving this (some knowledge of applications and knowledge sources). You need to know what you're aiming for. You need to know the minimum you can do to achieve a viable product (MVP).

                1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? 
                Include a link to your Trello board.
